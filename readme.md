## In this repo, I will share some setup of reverse proxies for linux servers, incase we will use docker compose as a first step then configrue traefik, then connect other docker images such as portainer and mailcow etc.

# Traefik Intallation

    #### lets create a new directory named containers;

    ```bash
    mkdir /containers
    cd /containers

    ```
    #### next step we will create another directory for traefik installation. In contuinues steps we will create directories for portainer , mailcow and other contaiers so it wil be listed in one main directory
